# TASK TRACKING: Ocelot API Gateway with Admin Portal

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW
- **Complexity Level**: 4 (Complex System)
- **Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with .NET 8, FastEndpoints, React + TypeScript

## TECHNOLOGY STACK VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS
- [ ] .NET 8 SDK verification and project templates
- [ ] FastEndpoints framework setup and configuration
- [ ] Ocelot Gateway integration validation
- [ ] Entity Framework Core setup with database
- [ ] React + Vite + TypeScript frontend stack
- [ ] SignalR real-time communication setup

## SYSTEM COMPONENTS
### Backend Components (Clean Architecture)
1. **Domain Layer**: Core business entities and domain logic
2. **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
3. **Infrastructure Layer**: Data access, external services
4. **WebApi Layer**: FastEndpoints REST API
5. **Gateway Layer**: Ocelot API Gateway with dynamic config

### Frontend Components
6. **Admin Portal**: React + TypeScript web application
7. **Real-time Updates**: SignalR integration for live config changes

## CREATIVE PHASES REQUIRED
- [ ] **[CREATIVE-ARCH]**: Overall System Architecture Design
- [ ] **[CREATIVE-DB]**: Database Schema Design
- [ ] **[CREATIVE-API]**: API Design and Documentation
- [ ] **[CREATIVE-UI]**: User Interface Design and UX
- [ ] **[CREATIVE-REALTIME]**: Real-time Communication Architecture
- [ ] **[CREATIVE-SECURITY]**: Security Architecture and Implementation

## PHASED IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Technology stack validation
- Project structure setup
- Core domain entities
- Basic infrastructure setup

### Phase 2: Backend Core (Weeks 3-4)
- Application services implementation
- Data access layer completion
- Basic API endpoints with FastEndpoints
- Unit testing framework setup

### Phase 3: Gateway Integration (Weeks 5-6)
- Custom Ocelot configuration provider
- Dynamic configuration loading mechanism
- Gateway-API integration testing
- Performance optimization and caching

### Phase 4: Frontend Development (Weeks 7-8)
- React + Vite application setup
- Core UI components for configuration management
- API integration with backend services
- SignalR integration for real-time updates

### Phase 5: Integration & Polish (Weeks 9-10)
- End-to-end integration testing
- Security hardening and audit
- Performance optimization and load testing
- Documentation completion and deployment

## RISKS AND MITIGATIONS
- **Risk 1**: Ocelot dynamic configuration complexity
  - **Mitigation**: Research phase, proof of concept, expert consultation
- **Risk 2**: Real-time updates performance impact
  - **Mitigation**: SignalR optimization, caching strategy, load testing
- **Risk 3**: Security vulnerabilities in dynamic config
  - **Mitigation**: Security review, penetration testing, secure coding
