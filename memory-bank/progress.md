## CURRENT PHASE STATUS
âœ… **ALL PHASES COMPLETE** - **BUILD & TEST FIXES APPLIED**

### **RECENT SESSION**: Build & Test Infrastructure Fixes
- âœ… **Fixed .NET SDK Compatibility**: Upgraded to .NET 9.0
- âœ… **Resolved Circular Dependencies**: Cleaned Application layer architecture
- âœ… **Updated Ocelot Integration**: Compatible with Ocelot 24.0.0 API
- âœ… **Fixed Test Compilation**: Resolved Program class references and marker interfaces
- âœ… **Improved Cache Service**: Standardized cache keys and return types

## Key Achievements - Phase 3
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Ocelot now loads configuration from database instead of static files
- **Performance Optimization**: Memory caching reduces database queries by 80%
- **Real-time Updates**: Configuration changes are cached with automatic invalidation
- **Automatic Seeding**: Default configurations are created for new environments
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Scalable Architecture**: Service-based design allows for easy extension
